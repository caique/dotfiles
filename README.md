# dotfiles

All my dotfiles! Hopefully I won't have to use them again soon...

### How To
* Install Homebrew, Git, and iTerm2
* Clone this repository into `~/.dotfiles`
* Execute `brew bundle` inside this folder
* The contents of `~/.zshrc` must be `source ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc`
* Don't forget to configure the annoying escape sequences on iTerm
* Be happy!
