# dotfiles

All my dotfiles! Hopefully I won't have to use them again soon...

### How To
* Install Homebrew and Git
* Clone this repository into `~/.dotfiles`
* Execute `brew bundle` inside this folder to install all CLI utilities and applications
* Execute `./configure.sh` to setup ZSH as default shell, generate your `~/.zshrc`, configure NeoVim init file, and install SDKMAN
* Don't forget to configure the annoying escape sequences on iTerm
* Be happy!
